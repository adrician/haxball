/**
 * This Haxball Headless Manager (HHM) plugin provides protection against
 * unwanted banning and kicking of players.
 * 
 * If player that **is not** protected bans/kicks a player that is protected
 * the banner gets banned/kicked himself and the banned player gets unbanned.
 * 
 * If player that **is** protected bans/kicks another protected player
 * the player does not get banned but the banned player gets unbanned.
 * 
 * If `allowOnlyProtectedRolesToBan` is set to `true`, then the plugin also
 * bans all unprotected players that are trying to ban other players and
 * removes the ban.
 * 
 * Depends on `sav/roles` plugin of the default HHM plugin repository.
